"""Speechmatics STT service with automatic reconnection.

Wraps pipecat's SpeechmaticsSTTService to handle stale WebSocket connections
that occur when the service sits idle behind a ServiceSwitcher. The underlying
VoiceAgentClient's session times out when no audio is sent, but the client
object remains non-None — causing TransportError on finalize().

This subclass detects a dead transport and reconnects before processing.
